# jsSnow 0.5.1

Updated with fixed HTML and uses the most current JavaScript code from Klepp's
site. The 0.5 version did not work for me (using Firefox 84 in 2020). Original
readme below:

## :snowflake: Hey, what's this? Looks like XSnow!

Yes, it is. I was looking for a port of my favorite toy, but didn't find any. So I took the graphics from Rick Jansens Xsnow 1.40 ([http://www.euronet.nl/~rja/](https://web.archive.org/web/20010124074300/http://www.euronet.nl/~rja/)), went to the kitchen, got me (Nikolaus Klepp, dr.klepp@gmx.at) a mixer, ice ... and here it is: the first XSnow port to JavaScript!


**Breaking news: after 17 years here's version 0.5 .. now with trees :)**

### Where to download?

here's is the whole package of this page. Please refer to the html sources of how to install. It works for Mozilla based browsers (Netscape ...), Konqueror, Opera and M$IE. Also take a look at the CHANGES.

### What's missing?

* Opera code needs fix (can't write to layer, can't show hidden layer). But as time goes by, maybe this point will vanish.
* Could somebody reorganize the code, please? :christmas_tree:
* Themes are still missing. Would get them for free when code gets object oriented.

### License?
[GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](LICENSE), of course :-)
